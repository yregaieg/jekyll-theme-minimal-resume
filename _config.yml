user_description: My name is Meher Slimene, I’m 35 years old, I’m Tunisian and I come from a modest and rural family, originating from Zaouit El Jedidi. Although I do not think  that I'm still very young, my youth was marked by the different events that ourTunisia went through from Bourguiba’s regime to Ben Ali’s, arriving at the Revolution which is the only thing that made us all dream and who guided us to our third republic, that of today.
